# Actividad| Aprendiendo Micro web frameworks

This is an aplication exercise introductory to the creation of a micro web faramework project. In this case we are using [scalatra](https://scalatra.org/) framework to deploy a [scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) aplication.

## Getting Started

To get the source files of this project click on the next link to download them as a .zip file: 
https://github.com/Esteban-J/Actividad-Aprendiendo-Micro-web-frameworks/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

### Prerequisites

In this project you will be executing bash commands. If you are not using a unix based operative system you'll need to download a bash cli.

To be able to run and test this project on your local machine you must have [scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) installed. Follow the instructions given on their website for it's instalation instructions: https://www.scala-lang.org/download/3.3.3.html

As well, you'll need to install [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) to run the scalatra project. Follow the instructions on the oficcial scalatra framework website to install sbt. https://scalatra.org/getting-started/installation.html

## Running the tests

Once having extracted the files inside your project directory, open a bash terminal on it and execute the following command to lift and start a server where the applccation will be deploy.

```
sbt ~Jetty/start
```
By default the server will be on http://localhost:8080

### Break down into end to end tests

## Built With

* [scalatra](https://scalatra.org/) - The web framework used
* [JDK](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) / to buil the scala project
